# Music Genre Classification - Classifying the genre of a music using deep neural networks
### Introduction<br>
Music Genre classification is one of the branches of Music Information Retrieval (MIR). A robust recommendation system begins with the categorization of music genres. Sound processing is a huge reaseach area through which we can find solutions to various medical or mental issues through music theraphy solutions. There are various music applications such as Spotify, Google Play, Apple Music, etc., but for implementation, one of the most important steps is to classify the genre of a music which requires audio processing, it is one of the most complex tasks that involves time signal processing, time series, spectrograms, spectral coefficients, and audio feature extraction to feed a neural network.

### Dataset description
The dataset used is GTZAN (the famous GTZAN dataset, the MNIST of sounds)

The GTZAN dataset contains 1000 audio files. Contains a total of 10 genres, each genre contains 100 audio files

1.Blues

2.Classical

3.Country

4.Disco

5.Hip-hop

6.Jazz

7.Metal

8.Pop

9.Reggae

10.Rock

#### Genres original
A compilation of ten genres, each with 100 audio recordings, each lasting 30 seconds (the famous GTZAN dataset, the MNIST of sounds)

#### Images original
Each audio file has a visual representation. Neural networks are one technique to classify data because they usually take in some form of picture representation.

#### CSV files
The audio files' features are contained within. Each song lasts for 30 seconds long has a mean and variance computed across several features taken from an audio file in one file. The songs are separated into 3 second audio files in the other file, which has the same format.

### Tensorflow
TensorFlow is a python's open source library developed by google which provides a collection of workflows to develop and train models using Python or JavaScript, and to easily deploy in the cloud, on-prem, in the browser, or on-device no matter what language you use. The tf. data API enables you to build complex input pipelines from simple, reusable pieces. It is used ease the process of acquiring data, training models, serving predictions, and refining future results.

Tensorflow makes it easy to work on our machine learning and deep learning models, hence We used tensorflow and keras in our notebook to train and test the deep learning model.
