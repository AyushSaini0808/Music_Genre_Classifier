# Music Genre Classification - Classifying the genre of a music using deep neural networksÂ¶
### Introduction<br>
Music Genre classification is one of the branches of Music Information Retrieval (MIR). A robust recommendation system begins with the categorization of music genres. Sound processing is a huge reaseach area through which we can find solutions to various medical or mental issues through music theraphy solutions. There are various music applications such as Spotify, Google Play, Apple Music, etc., but for implementation, one of the most important steps is to classify the genre of a music which requires audio processing, it is one of the most complex tasks that involves time signal processing, time series, spectrograms, spectral coefficients, and audio feature extraction to feed a neural network.
